# Metropolis Adjusted Microcanonical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo


Qualifying paper #2 with Trevor Campbell:
[Metropolis Adjusted Microcanonical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01707) by Jakob Robnik, Reuben Cohn-Gordon, and Uroš Seljak.


The project directory is organized as:  
* [/code](https://github.com/1saacRankin/QP2-microcanonical-HMC/tree/main/code) for the code to run experiments for the small project.
* [/code/plots](https://github.com/1saacRankin/QP2-microcanonical-HMC/tree/main/code/plots) for plots generated by the code and used for the report.
* [/report](https://github.com/1saacRankin/QP2-microcanonical-HMC/tree/main/report) for the files to produce the report.


### The project will compare sequential and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning.
